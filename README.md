# Advent of Code 2025

This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written
in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).  
The main goal this year was to learn Kotlin.

## Structure

All solutions are separated by package according to the day.  
Each solution is run by the `Runner` Kotlin file in the base package.  
Tests are included for the sample input published on the puzzle site.

## Puzzle Input

The sample input is included in the `src/test/resources` directory.  
My personal puzzle input is not included per Advent of Code recommendations.  
If you want to run this yourself, you can add your input to `src/resources` as text files, named `day1.txt`, `day2.txt`
and so-on.
